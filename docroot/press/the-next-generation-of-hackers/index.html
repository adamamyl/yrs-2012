      WITHOUT EMBARGO<br />

      <br />Young Rewired State: The Next Generation of Hackers<br />

      <br />The first week in August will see the third annual Young Rewired State taking place: a week long multi-site event where hackers (software developers) under 18 receive support to compete in building applications that make innovate uses of government data to improve the quality of life, and making released data useable by their peers, parents, and grandparents.<br />

      <br />Young Rewired State takes place each year filling the void in the National Curriculum, allowing a work-experience-style opportunity for those with an aptitude to code or design websites or build computer 
      software to Actually Build Things (websites, applications, games) with support — not only from their peers, but the open source community, and a network of mentors: outside of their bedrooms.<br />

      <br />Taking over 50 young-people, and in a dozen centres from Brighton to Newcastle and Norwich to Cardiff (full details of centres at <a href="../../../map">../../../map</a>, the next generation will work on their mashups, making a spot of bother/trouble as they go.<br />

      <br />There&#8217;s still time for young-people to signup <a href="../../../signup">signup</a> : some centres have vacancies[1].<br />

      <br />Young Rewired State will conclude with all developers, their mentors, and optionally, a relative/carer coming to London (UK), for the finale: a show and tell event where the developers will explain and demonstrate their week&#8217;s efforts to a selected audience of their peers, politicians, advisers, civil servants, and the press. For those wishing to attend Show and Tell, please express an interest via
      <a href="http://yrs2011.eventbrite.com/">http://yrs2011.eventbrite.com/</a>.<br />

      <br />Adam McGreggor, from Rewired State said:<br />

      <br />“Young Rewired State provides a fantastic opportunity for the next generation of coders to show what they can do, gathering real-world experience in responsible hacking in a social forum. It&#8217;s lamentable that there is this gap in the curriculum, but it&#8217;s crucial that they gain these skills, especially with digital first in the information age. Anyone able really should try and get involved. Go for it.”<br />

      <br />Emma Mulqueeny, founder of Young Rewired State, explains:<br />

      <br />“Young Rewired State was started because we could see developers everywhere getting excited about government starting to open its data, but no one under the age of 25 seemed to be engaging. We thought we’d try to call out for socially conscious young coders and give them an exciting host venue and a challenge, with prizes, to see if we could light the fire in their bellies. It worked!  Young Rewired State is now more than an annual event, it is a network of coders aged 18 or under and it is growing and giving these young people experiences, mentoring and opportunities never before seen amongst this community.&#8221;<br />

      “Excellent initiative to find all those young geeks in the UK. If you are 18 or under and can code go!”<br />
