      <p>Young Rewired State: Young Geeks Coding a Better Country<br />

      <br />“Can’t vote, but can put a wind in Government’s sails.”<br />

      <br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      Friday, 5th August, 2011.<br />

      <br />19:00 hours.<br />

      <br />The UK future geek superstars have been unearthed, mentored, celebrated, and rewarded during a week-long government data hack event run by Rewired State across the country this week.<br />

      <br />For the third consecutive year, Young Rewired State (YRS) has taken place. YRS selects young people from 8 to 18, who can code and love it. Whether they have rudimentary coding knowledge from being taught in schools, or have spent days, weeks and months teaching themselves, every single one was invited to join a UK-wide week-long hack for under 18s.<br />

      <br />The only rule was that hacks had to use at least one open government data set. Scraping data [ turning webpages into machine-readable formats ] was totally fine, the idea being to take government data to do public good.<br />

      <br />The young people received support from a roaming team of mentors, and had a local centre (often a geeky business) to work in for the duration of the week, before presenting their ideas to an audience of press, VCs, civil servants, geeks, industry specialists, entrepreneurs, peers and a distinguished panel of judges.<br />

      <br />Prizes were donated by Google, Microsoft, Nokia, and Samfry, supported by the geek twitterati. The Friday show-and-tell venue this year was kindly provided (with pizza and many willing hands) by Microsoft. Mentors, including YRS 2009/10 alumni, donated their time over the course of the week.<br />

      <br /><strong>Jonathan Luff</strong>, Prime Minister&#8217;s Office, 10 Downing Street said:<br />
      <quote>
      &#8220;Young Rewired State allows us to glimpse the future. It is wonderful to see talented and creative young people developing fantastic hacks and apps for the benefit of our communities using open data.
      <br />
      If this is what they can achieve now, in just one week, I can only imagine what they will go on to achieve in the future.&#8221;

      <br /><strong>Emma Mulqueeny</strong> of Rewired State &#8212; the organization running Young Rewired State, says:<br />
      <quote>
      &#8220;Young Rewired State was started because we could see developers everywhere getting excited about government starting to open its data, but no one under the age of 25 seemed to be engaging. We thought we’d try to call out for socially conscious young coders and give them an exciting host venue and a challenge, with prizes, to see if we could light the fire in their bellies. It worked! Young Rewired State is now more than an annual event, it is a network of coders aged 18 or under and it is growing and giving these young people experiences, mentoring and opportunities never before seen amongst this community.&#8221;

      <br /><strong>Mike Butcher</strong>, a judge said that the quality of presentations and pitches were <br />
      <quote>&#8220;better than the Apprentice&#8221;</quote><br />

      <br />Having seen the hacks, from 14 centres around England and Wales, from Pool to Newcastle, and Bristol to Norwich, the judges awarded these hacks prizes:<br />

      <br />
      <li><h4>Best in show (concept and code)</h4>
      <strong>Norwich Blocks</strong> Milo Mordaunt &amp; Ben Holloway, from the <strong>Norwich</strong> Centre<br />
      <em>Maps broadband data in a different way</em>.</li><br />

      <br /><li><h4>Best example of coding (code)</h4>
      <strong>Where’s my Train</strong> Thomas Shadwell, from the <strong>Bletchley Park/National Museum of Computing</strong> Centre<br />
      <em>Uses data about train arrivals, top speed and delays to estimate the position of a train to be plotted on a Google map.</em><br />
      Winner’s Quote: <quote>&#8220;I’m just amazed I won the prize. I’m lost for words. I’m impressed at how easy it was to use Google Maps. Being able to visualize data, that’s what it’s all about&#8221;</quote>
      </li><br />

      <br /><li><h4>Most likely to be bought (code or concept)</h4>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>UniMatch</strong> Leon Byford, Richard Meadows, Joanne Ogunseitah, Hugo Altendorf, Kerron Parchment, Priscilla Ossai, from the <strong>Fluxx</strong> (London) Centre<br />
      <em>Helps find a university that is right for the user, using distance, fees, UCAS points, night life etc.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Urbani</strong> Hamish Back, Brandon White, Matt Tung, Rebecca Tung, Adam King, Matthew Lewis, from the <strong>Guildford</strong> Centre<br />
      <em>Essentially a pedestrian heat map, showing the busiest pedestrian areas in London. We realised that there were already apps for car congestion but not for pedestrians. Initially we were only gearing the idea towards the Olympics &#8211; as a way to inform the general public of the most congested areas of London and where the longest queues were. This could then be used by non-Olympics goers to avoid the busy Olympic areas. Users could avoid the most congested areas, making for a more efficient and quick journey to their destination. We assumed that every person with a GPS system or mobile phone would allow their location to be broadcast and then use geo-location to detect where in London they were. Anonymous data like this is, held by mobile phone companies, but not publicly available which is why we haven&#8217;t used it in our project.</em><br />
      Winner’s Quote: <quote>&#8220;It was a really good thing to do. It was a great experience&#8221;.</quote>
      </li></ul></li><br />

      <br /><li><h4>Wish the Government would do this (concept)</h4>
      <strong>myNHS</strong> James Thompson, Harry Rickards, Lewis Bryant, from the <strong>Brighton</strong> Centre<br />
      <em>myNHS is a brand new way of linking patients with the NHS. The app focuses on 4 main things. Location, GPs, prescriptions and bookings. We want to be able to make thing easier for people by providing a friendly UI. With location we want people to be able to find their local A&amp;Es, chemists and pharmacies &#8211; especially ones which are open late. We also wanted to make the prescription system a lot easier by being able to let users especially with repeat prescriptions be able to order their prescription off the website and app using unique QR Codes. Also many people occasionally feel worried about the drugs they will be taking and turn to google to find out what they are. What we do is in the site and app provide a drugs database allowing people to look up drugs and see their description, model, what the side effects are and recognized dosages. This will help save time for both GPs and patients and make the current system MUCH smoother.</em><br />
      Winner’s Quote: <quote>&#8220;I found it amazing Government found it a good idea. We wanted to show government that it was possible due to a big group effort. We’re hoping to be implicated in the future&#8221;.</quote></li><br />

      <br /><li><h4>Most likely to annoy a Government CIO &#8211; CIO council award (code or concept)</h4>
      <strong>Solar</strong> Joe and Issy, from the <strong>Osmosoft</strong> (London) Centre<br />
      <em>This project takes the limited dataset we could find from Ofgem (some data on energy generation over the country), strips out only photovoltaic installation information and then plots the coordinates of their rough locations from the first part of postcodes on a Google map. The original idea was to map all the solar photovoltaic installations in the country, with their kWh capacity, to see the trend in uptake and possible north/south divide. We didn’t, however, get the data to do that, so we improvised with some data we did get!</em><br />
      Winner’s Quote:<quote>&#8220;It was fantastic and a good experience. We persevered and learnt new things&#8221;</quote></li><br />

      <br /><li><h4>Best mobile project (code or concept)</h4>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Alex Reed, Dylan Maryk, Simion Putina, Kevin Lewis, Kerim Hudson, from the <strong>Guardian</strong> (London) Centre<br />
      <em>Designed in order to join together the elements that can be found out about a neighbourhood. By entering a postcode, you are able to find out about Education (the schools/colleges/universities in the area), Crime, Lifestyle (containing facts about lifespan, population, life expectancy). This allows for people who are looking to move into an area to see what it is like to live there, as well as an interesting application for people who are curious about their area.</em></li>
      <li><strong>TrainTracker</strong> Michael Mokrysz, from the <strong>MadLab Manchester</strong> Centre<br />
      <em>A way to follow up on train punctuality, as well as to see how fast trains go on different parts of their routes. At the moment it comes down to using a custom-developed iPhone app&#8217;s Location services to track your journey, and then after-the-fact processing that data to get what you&#8217;re after. This is then uploaded to the site and displayed.</em><br />
      Quote: <quote>&#8220;I started knowing nothing about iOS location services, and ended up winning a prize&#8221;.</quote></li>
      </ul></li><br />

      <br /><br /><strong>Helen Millner</strong> presenting the award said:<br />
      <quote>&#8220;I’m amazed at the week’s work. It’s considered, by default, not only those already on line, but also those who will be going online for their first-time.&#8221;</quote>
      <br />

      <br /><li><h4>Best data workaround (code)</h4>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>PacMap</strong> Benn Webb &amp; Josh Pickett, from the <strong>MadLab Manchester</strong> Centre<br />
      <em>Its Pacman&hellip; On a map&hellip;</em></li>
      <li><strong>Food for Thought</strong> Joel Murphy from the <strong>Cardiff</strong> Centre<br /><em>An HTML5 web app that uses official data from the Food Standards Agency Hygiene ratings scheme to allow users to find out the official hygiene ratings of food outlets from restaurants and cafés to burger vans and school canteens. Users can search for a business by location or make use of the built in geolocation features to pin point establishments close to their location.<br />The app helps users to discover hygiene ratings of establishments and therefore informing them on whether or not the food is likely to be safe to eat of will leave them with nasty side effects!</em></li>
      </ul>
      </li><br />
