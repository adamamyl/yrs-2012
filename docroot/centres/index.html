<h3>What qualifies as a centre?</h3>

<p>A centre is a business of any size, that includes developers. You need to have enough space to host anywhere from 3 young developers upwards and you need to have people available from the 6-11th August. You should have wifi that works and is robust enough to take the number of young developers you agree to host.</p>

<h3>What do we have to do as a centre?</h3>

<p>Between now and August you should look locally for young developers. We will send you material: flyers and logos and so on. We will also team you up with a centre who has already hosted before, and they will be able to answer your questions. You will be responsible for giving information out that comes from us to your young devs, for making sure that they are ready on the Monday with all the details on how to get to you, how to get into the building and so on, and you will be responsible for feeding them - whether that be that you feed them, or you make sure that they bring their own food. At the end of the week, someone from the centre should accompany the young devs to Bletchley Park for the big sleepover and support them as they prepare their presentations for the Saturday afternoon. You will also be responsible for making sure that all the kids have made arrangements to get home afterwards.</p>

<h3>Recruiting young people:</h3>

<p>We are signing young people up centrally who hear about this over the grapevine and will be sorting these into areas and assigning them centres, and actively seeking areas that have no businesses registered but do have YP interested.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>For young people to qualify for YRS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>they have to be able to at least edit HTML (we will send them resource packages in the months ahead of the event to improve their skills)</p></li>
<li><p>to be aged 18 or under</p></li>
<li><p>they will need a laptop (unless your company can provide them)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have enough devs, let me know and we will mark your centre as full and start hunting for more in your area if we have too many young dev sign ups.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>You do NOT need CRB checks, as you are acting in a similar way to businesses using interns and school placements over the summer. But there must be only one open space used and not small break-out rooms.</p>

<h3>How will the week work?</h3>

<p>The idea is that the young developers come in on the Monday morning and have a brainstorming session with your developers and whoever else might want to get involved. (We will send mentors and alumni to every centre over the course of the week.) They look at the data we have sent out previously, and choose either a data set they want to play with and get as many apps as they can out of, or a theme/issue they want to tackle using a variety of open data sets. (The only rule here is that it needs to use data from at least one open set, it can be mashed with as many other data sets (or your own) as they like).</p>
<br /><br />
<p>They begin to build an idea and can work on this in a group or individually. By the second day, they need to start coding. They will then spend the rest of the week developing their idea and creating it. We are going to set up some kind of clarion call between centres that week, with cries for help or offers of assistance all over the YRS website; I am hoping that this will attract attention from local experts across the UK who may want to come in and help with, for example, front end design, game development, specific coding dilemmas - that kind of thing.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>On the Friday everyone will be descending on the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park for a continued codathon. This will go on throughout Friday night, with everyone bringing tents - although we don't expect there will be much sleeping time - we anticipate a *lot* of coding and playing with BBC Micros!</p>
<br /><br />
<p>Show and tell is on the Saturday in the afternoon to a panel of judges, press, industry and government.</p>
<br /><br />
