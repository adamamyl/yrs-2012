      <p>Fancy hacking the Government into shape? Want to create websites and applications that can help you, your school, town, country or the world? 

      <br /><br />How about we give you one week, technology and a ton of the country's best programmers and hackers to help and teach you along the way? We'll also give you food and drink to keep you going and the chance to present your projects at Bletchley Park. 

      <br /><br />If so, and you're under 18, we'd love you to come and hack to see what you can come up with. We think we're all in for a big surprise.
