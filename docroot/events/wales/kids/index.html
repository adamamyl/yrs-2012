      <p>Fancy hacking the Government into shape? Want to create websites and applications that can help you, your school, town, country or the world?

      <br /><br />How about we give you a weekend, technology and a ton of the country's best programmers and hackers to help and teach you along the way? We'll also give you food and drink to keep you going and the chance to present your projects at Cardiff Metropolitan University.

      <br /><br />If so, and you're under 18, we'd love you to come and hack to see what you can come up with. We think we're all in for a big surprise.

      <br /><br />If you're worried about not being skilled enough, view our skill requirements below:

      <br /><br />As with any geek event, the skill levels required to attend Young Rewired State has been a source of concern for many people. This is totally normal when people first approach a geek group, but very rarely a genuine issue once you arrive.
      So here is a brief clarification.
      We're not so much looking for skills but rather a mind set. A good indicator of this to us would be you have done something hacky. Here's a brief list of things we'd consider a good indicator: (anything from this list is a sign you're excited by technology, and is by no means complete)</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Made a website with some understanding of HTML and CSS.</p></li>
      <li><p>Installed blog or forum software and played around – such as wordpress/drupal/phpbb.</p></li>
      <li><p>Written your own script.</p><li>
      <li><p>Have used a unix/linux command line, or Mac OS X terminal.</p></li>
      <li><p>Know basic programming knowledge (ie. 'while loops' and 'if statements' are.)</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>In other words, we want you to have 'tinkered' with computers in your own time and of your own accord.
